    "# General notes\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks let you run python code in your browser. It is a called a notebook because you can mix descriptive text as well as math with python code to examplify implementations and do visualizations. This is made possible by dividing the notebook into cells, which can contain either code or text (this is a text cell). Text cells utilize markdown to format the text while also providing support for LaTeX commands to support writing of math symbols and equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find numerous quick guides on markdown by searching the internet ([for example this one](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)). Here is nonetheless a couple of examples: **bold text**, *italicized text*, and an ordered list:\n",
    "1. first item,\n",
    "2. second item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enclosing text with '\\\\$' signs ensures that the content is interpreted as LaTex. You can therefore, for exampel, write an equaiton in text like $y=kx+b$, and it between text paragraphes using standard [LaTex environment commands](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y=kx+b.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "A few more examples include $\\hat{y}, \\alpha, \\beta, \\sum, \\int, \\nabla$. Together, these features let you write very detailed descriptions to explain what you are trying to examplify with the code cells in your notebook. So let us look at a code cell next."
