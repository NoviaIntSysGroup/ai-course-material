This corresponds to the RPM (revolutions per minute) frequency that the machine is running at (10 000 / 60 = 166.7 Hz). However, we expect that the characteristic sound of faults is found other frequencies. One neat way to remove the dominance of the RPM frequency is to pre-process the data by simply taking the logarithm."
