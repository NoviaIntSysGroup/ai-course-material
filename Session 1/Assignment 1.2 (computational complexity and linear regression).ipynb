    "### Computational complexity\n",
    "It is always useful to have at least a rough idea of the computational complexity of your data analysis. By this I mean the amount of computations that has to be performed and how this changes as a function of data collected. One common way to assess this is to consider how the amount of computations increase as your gather more data. However, one is rarely interested in the exact time taken (that depends on your hardware) but rather how the computations scales: does the computation time grow linearly ($\\propto n^1$), quadratically ($\\propto n^2$), cubically ($\\propto n^3$), etc. For example, if the computation time grows cubicly, then it will take 1000 times longer to do your analysis if you collect ten times more data. Worst case scenario is then that you go through the trouble of collecting 10 times more data just to find out that you don't have the time and resources to analyze it. In this assignment you will get a little bit more familiar with computational complexity by analyzing how long it takes to compute the distance between all data points in your data set."
